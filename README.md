**Galt Project is an international decentralized land and real estate property registry governed by DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization) and self-governance protocol for communities of homeowners built on top of Ethereum blockchain.**

**@galtproject/core repo contains smart contracts for a Single consistent decentralized land and real estate registry. Any land and real-estate property owner can create his property tokens with the help of the decentralized community of cadastral engineers and notaries. Tokens can be created for commercial purposes or for the self-government of property owners.**

:page_with_curl: **For more information read the [Whitepaper](https://github.com/galtproject/galtproject-docs/blob/master/en/Whitepaper.md)**

:construction: **@galtproject/core stage: Testnet**

At the moment, @galtproject/core contracts are deployed in our private Testnet(RPC: https://https-rpc.testnet-58.galtproject.io/, Explorer: https://explorer.testnet-58.galtproject.io/), we are preparing a deployment of the first version of contracts on the mainnet.

:bomb: **Security review status: Unaudited**

Unfortunately, we do not currently have sufficient resources for a full audit of the created contracts. 

Our team believes that the Galt Project will enable people to transact land and real estate without borders and third parties. As well as creating self-governing communities without corruption and with transparent governance processes. 
You can contribute to this by checking the code and creating an issue, or by making a small donation to the address of the team **0x98064493535B22F6EbDf475341F0A6DaaBb7b538**.

Also you can use our [Galt Project dApp](https://app.galtproject.io/) on mainnet with Private Property Regostries functionality to support Galt Project!

:memo:**Get started contributing with a good first [issue](https://github.com/galtproject/galtproject-core/issues)**.

# Contracts overview
This repository @galtproject/core contains main project contracts:
- **SpaceToken.sol** - ERC721 Token. Each Token contains geospatial data and represents a particular land plot, whole building, room, or several rooms. We employ World Geodetic System (WGS84) as a primary Geodetic datum.
- **Governance Contracts (GlobalGovernance.sol,ACL.sol,ApplicationRegistry.sol,FeeRegistry.sol,GaltGlobalRegistry.sol,SpaceGeoDataRegistry.sol and others)** - contracts used for decentralized protocol governance (setting access rights for call contracts, defining contract parameters, etc.).
- **Applications** - Contracts used for interaction between protocol participants. For example, the Property Owner through one of the contracts can apply for the creation / change of the token, and the Cadastral engineer can approve its creation / change.
- **Factories** - Contract factories used by users.
- **PGG or Protocol Governance Group** - Contracts uniting real estate owners and Oracles (Cadastral engineers and Notaries) geographically into a group to create tokens and select Arbitrators to resolve disputes.
- **Reputation** - All protocol participants have a reputation by which they manage contracts. These contracts are used for reputation accounting.

## For Developers
